## Weekly Reflection

- The purpose of this page is to track progress made for the Reservation Platform Individual Project, providing a general overview of how things are going/have gone:



### Week 3

2/10/26 - Even though the semester has presented some technology barriers I am continuing to work through, developing the initial plan, concept, and overall direction for this project has been rewarding to me. It feels like I am not just completing an assignment (even at this stage), but axtually attempting to create a potential solution to a real-world problem that I have personally experienced. That connection to the problem has made the planning process more meanigful and motivating.

Writing the user stories in particular felt especially valuable - they were based around years of feedback shared while helping at the diner. I've listened to customers express frustration, and heard admins discuss what works, what doesn't, and what they wish the system could do better. Drawing from those real conversations made the user stories feel authentic and grounded in actual needs rather than assumptions.

Reviewing comments and suggestions from both customers and staff also helped me think critically about usability and practicality. From the customer who wants a quick and simple reservation process, to the manager/admin who wants accurate tracking and fewer operational headaches, it really had me thinking about different user-centeric perspectives. The wireframe layouts felt a little tricky to really pinpoint what could be the most useful and impactful for user experience, but at this point the awareness of it I feel will significantly impact the design process along the road, aiming to result in the best overall experience.

One thing I am curious (and a bit concerned) about is how I will effectively test the system, particularly regarding the primary issue of overbooking caused by race conditions. The current reservation system struggles when a high volume of users attempt to book at the same time. Replicating that high traffic scenario in this class project setting is well... a challenge to hae happen. It has me question on how to properly test whether my proposed solution truly prevents conflicts. Further research into strategies for handling concurrency will be an important next step.

Overall, Week 3 has reinforced that thoughtful preparation is crucial. Even with the challenges, I am excited to continue working towards something that addresses a problem I have seen firsthand and to see how my ideas evolve as the project progresses.
